## Build/Export
- Build version of the game is available in the [release](https://github.com/Arivval/Game-Project/releases) section, which you can use `adb install DotGo.apk` to install onto your USB Debugging enabled Android devices. This version of the game is only tested on Google Pixel 3a running Android 10
- You can also build the game yourself in Godot engine; A [guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/workflow/export/exporting_for_android.html) can be found here. You may also want to enable vibrate permission under export -> options -> permissions -> vibrate in Godot engine since this game utilizes the vibrate motor to provide feedback for the player.
- Hope you will enjoy this game! :D
